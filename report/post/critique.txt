Critique:

Overall, we found that the critique seems to hold well - we were able to observe
a downward spiral effect within a web client of a popular video streaming
service. Notably, we were able to replicate the results even though we are using
different hardware and software to emulate network links, which indicates that
the results of the original paper are robust to the network emulation layer.

Additionally, like the original authors of the paper, we observed that in cases
where we observed a downward spiral effect, manually setting a bit-rate allows
better link utilization in the presence of a competing flow.

Furthermore, based on our experince with YouTube's client, we observe that some
web clients do not exhibit this effect, indicating that their clients may be
more conservative in reducing bit rate in the presence of competing flows.
Since YouTube's client was not one that was tested in the original paper, we do
not know if it previously exhibited a downward spiral, or whether it was changed
since the publication of the original paper.

Extensions:

We experimented with generating graphs using different moving average filters.
Below are the same graphs as above using a 200 ms moving average filter to
smooth the throughput, instead of a 4 second moving average.

The original paper used buffers to induce latency in their connection. We
experimented with varying buffer sizes on the downlink to test the sensitivity
of the experimental results to this parameter. We found that with a downlink
buffer size set too low, which causes packet loss in addition to latency, the
clients cuts the bit rate upon packet loss, preventing the link from being
saturated. (Figure forthcoming)

We will experiment with the throughput rate set on the downlink to see if the
downward spiral effect is sensitive to this value.
