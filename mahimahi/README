Prerequisites:

- Screen resolution within VM should be at least 1280x1024
- Should be able to support 5Mb/s throughput on network link. A wired link is preferable


To replicate:
run `./run.sh <source>` where source is one of youtube, vimeo, or local
The following manual steps are required when the browser opens up:
- make the video fullscreen
- play the video if it is not auto-playing
- (optional) use ALT+TAB to confirm that there are three downlink graphs open. These track the throughput of the browser, the direct download, and the combined link
- wait for 200 seconds
- pause the video, exit fullscreen
- right click in the network section of the developer tools and click "Save all as HAR"
- exit the browser

After you exit the browser, if everything went smoothly, then the graph will be generated in the figures directory. Otherwise, examine the output for errors.

The most common issue we have noted in replication is that there is no internet connectivity in mahimahi shells that are newly spawned through mm-link. To mitigate the effect of this issue, we test network connectivity with ping once mm-link spawns a shell, and if we cannot establish a connection, we fail the experiment with descriptive output. If you see this happening, interrupt the execution of the experiment with CTRL+C, then run './scripts/cleanup.sh', and then rerun the experiment.

Additionally, make sure not to suspend or try to exit the VM while the experiment is in progress as this can affect the timing computations.
